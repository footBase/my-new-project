# Environment data visualization

Idea to optimize learning by combining self-expirience & data visualization. 



## Summary

This would brinng information to the user thru eyesight, by using world libary compareshment. Unregenaicible data would be added to the libary and all the information relating to it. 

## Background

Environment A.I visualiziser :  

* Visual libary information
* Survival guide
* User optimizer


## How is it used?

Information would be provided as visual and voice.
There would be three parts, whom the user itself would be able to install. User control by eye movoment, voice detection, Motherboard controlls. 

### Lens

Lens would provide visual information as guidance, by following pupil movement.
The lens would be removable at anytime, so surgical procedure wouldn't be needed.

### Ear device

Voice guidance thru ear device, where information and navigation would be provided. This device would be installed to ear canal, by the user. 


### Motherboard

Motherboard would have similar features as smart phone, also place for users personal A.I.
* A.I recognizing
* Access to world libary
* Visual data storing
* Connection: lens/ear device 


## Data sources and AI methods
Data would be collected to wordl libary and updated by institutions and users.  

## Challenges
Keeping information accessible to users

## What next?

Project will improve with data
